INTRODUCTION

The AWE API is a PHP language based Application Programming Interface (API) that allows developers to build custom web and mobile-based administrative applications while communicating with the AWE servers.

The AWE API is ideal for customers who want to build custom administrative interfaces.

This is a beta release.  Once we've had enough testing and usage we'll update this to a full version 1.

USAGE

Before start using it you'll need an API KEY, you can get one here

http://developer.dealercloud.com/api/register.php

The API KEY allows you to run in developer mode and test your application, once you're ready to run on production mode you need to send an email to blake@autowebengine.com and ask for a production key. At the moment the production keys are manually processed and approved one by one.

If you need a developer broker account you also need to send an email and ask for one, as all the developer api keys are dealers accounts.

CONFIGURATION

If you want to run the examples you need to change the API KEY in the config.php file.

The Client php object requires an API KEY to operate on the methods, except on user login.

TESTING

You can test the API methods on the developer center, here

http://developer.dealercloud.com/api/test.php 

Using your API KEY you can test all the available api methods, and in the package you can find examples for each method as well.

BUGS

This is a beta release, if you find any bugs or something not working as expected please send an email to blake@autowebengine.com and we'll fix it in the short term.
